<img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/256/kotlin.png" alt="drawing" width="20"/> I am currently developing in Kotlin, but for a long time I worked with Java <img src="https://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/tatice/cristal-intense/256/Java-icon.png" alt="drawing" width="20"/>. I'm just as good with C# and Xamarin.  
Well versed in C++ and familiar with Python and JavaScript.  

A little bit about me:
- 🏡 At the moment I live in St. Petersburg, Russia.
- 🎓 I am a diligent 3rd year student at ITMO University.
- 🗣️ My level of English is C1. I have good practice communicating with native speakers.
- 🏐 Advanced volleyball player.
- 🎸 Dependent on music.

I can always be contacted via email, telegram or vk.
