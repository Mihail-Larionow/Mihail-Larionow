<img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/256/kotlin.png" alt="drawing" width="20"/> I am currently developing in Kotlin, but for a long time I worked with Java <img src="https://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/tatice/cristal-intense/256/Java-icon.png" alt="drawing" width="20"/>. I'm just as good with C# and Xamarin.  
Well versed in C++ and familiar with Python and JavaScript.
